# Extended C  

Extended C is a cross platform library and tools set for writing C programs with easy to use variables, arrays, lists, queues and stacks and gain their related functions without additional coding. It also help you to develop programs with objects in mind in pure C. Also you can manage memory automatically without leaks if you are interested in.

As a simple example think you need to create a list of students in a classroom.

### Example:  

>*\#define student_vars* \  
    *int     no;*     \  
    *char   name[20]*;  

>*EC_LIST_ALL(Student, student_vars)*  


With this few lines of code above,  

- Student_New()  
- Student_Append()  
- Student_Insert()  
- Student_Replace()  
- Student_Sort()  
- Student_Delete()  

and many other functions which related with lists are freely available for you. You just need to use them as you like.
