# Extended C 

Extended C is a library and a tool kit to write C programs easily with extended variables, automated memory and C objects in mind.

Think you need to create a list of students in a classroom.  

>*EC_LIST(Student, student_vars)*  

With above line of code where student_vars is simply a set of variables which related to a student like name, index, age, grade etc... then you will get,

- Student_New()  
- Student_Append()  
- Student_Insert()  
- Student_Replace()  
- Student_Sort()  
- Student_Delete()  

and many other functions freely without writing them.  

EC is purposely written so that it's much more customizable to optimize your code to gain it's maximum performance. Some times it may not necessary but possibilities may arise if you wish.
